## **Straightforward Implementation**
To run the program, it will be found in the **Straightforward Method** folder and inside will be the **DijStraAlg.py** file. If you would like to modify the input of nodes, it will be found in *SimpleTest.txt* file and one can add the node and weight but it will have to be written in the same format. Another thing one has to do after modifying the txt file is changing the number of nodes in the man method. It is represented as **n**. Works for any input of nodes.

## **Heap Implementation**
To run the program, it will be found in the **dijkstra Heap** folder and inside will be the **HeapDijstra.py** file. If you would like to modify the input it will be in the *ChallengeDataSet.txt* file.
